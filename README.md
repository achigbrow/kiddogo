This app is a simple list of tasks that must be completed in a certain time on selected days. The 
tasks will be displayed as individual pages and reward messages will play when the user completes 
all tasks in the required time.


V1 of this app is geared toward parents of children ages 4-8 who may need assistance in providing a 
structured task/reward system for their children. Future iterations of the app will evolve to appeal 
to teachers/educational assistants for classroom applications, individuals looking toward 
self-improvement through positive habit creation, and managers looking for a metrics-management 
system.

This app will rely on inputs from the device alarm system (maybe), a calendar to select dates to 
exclude from the playable days, a calendar to display monthly score data, and audio/visual inputs 
from external sources. I am also considering hooking into the 

Persistent data for the app will include the settings selected by the parent to establish timing, 
tasks, and rewards and the child's record going back one month. 

Primary navigation will be bottom buttons and tapping/swiping between completed tasks.
