V1 of this app is geared toward parents of children ages 4-8 who may need assistance in providing a structored task/reward system for their children. Future iterations of the app will evolve to appeal to teachers/educational assistants for classroom applications, individuals looking toward self-improvement through positive habit creation, and managers looking for a metrics-management system.

This app will rely on inputs from the device alarm system (maybe), a calendar to select dates to exclude from the playable days, and audio/visual inputs from external sources. Parents will be able to select the sound playback they want to play for successes and failures. I am also considering hooking into the device recording system to allow parents to record a message if that is not complicated.

Persistent data for the app will include the settings selected by the parent to establish timing, tasks, and rewards and the child's record going back 30 days. 

Primary navigation will rely on tabbed/swiped display of individual tasks followed by two feed back screens: an inital reward/fail for the day and a star or x on a chart for the week and/or month. I'm looking to restrict the swiping on the activity screens to require the child to tap a completion box before moving to the next screen.
