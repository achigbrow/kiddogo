## Parent User Stories
As a parent of a young child, I want an app that will help me to provide structure, immediate  
feedback, and rewards to my child to encourage them to get dressed and ready for school in a 
reasonable amount of time in the morning. I should be able to customize settings for days, time, and timers. I should also be able to review my child's weekly and monthly progress.


* As a parent, I want the ability to select what calendar date the app will begin and end the game 
so that I can align it with the school year.

* As a parent, I want to select the days of the week that I want this program to run so that I can 
choose to run the program just during the school week or on weekends as well.

* As a parent, I want the ability to exclude holidays and summer vacation from the days that the 
program will run so that my child can have more freedom during the holidays.

* As a parent, I want the ability to set what time this program will run on the days selected to run
so that it aligns with when my child will be waking up for school.

* As a parent, I want the ability to set a timer for how long the child has to complete the task 
sequence each morning so that my child is ready when it is time to leave.

* As a parent, I want the ability to review a weekly and monthly calendar of how my child is doing as far as 
completing the tasks on time.

## Child User Stories
As a child, I want an app that makes getting ready for school more fun. I want to know how I did and
feel like I am racing with myself.

* As a child, I want to hear and read my task instructions so that I know what I need to do.


* As a child, I want to see a greeting message and hear a good morning sound each morning to let me 
know that it is time to begin.

* As a child, I want to tap on the greeting to advance to the first slide with my first task.

* As a child, I want to tap on each subsequent task that I have completed to advance to the next task.

* As a child, I want to hear a success sound when I complete a task so that I have a que that tells 
me I've done well.

* As a child, I want to hear warning beepers at 5 minutes, 3 minutes, and 1 minute until my time is 
up so that I know when I need to hurry.

* As a child, I want to see a success screen when I complete my tasks on time that plays a success 
sound and displays a gold star so that I have immediate positive feedback.

* As a child, I want to see a try again next time screen when I fail to complete my tasks on time 
that displays/plays a positive message to try again so that I know I didn't succeed but that I can 
try again tomorrow.

* As a child, I want to see a weekly calendar with stars marking days that I have successfully 
completed my tasks and red x's on days that I did not successfully complete my tasks displayed after 
my daily success/try again screen so that I know how well I am doing for the week.
